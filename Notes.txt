Define hand class including draw() and discard()

Create game
 - need usernames to include
 - order of usernames determines user_order
 - prep_deck()
 - insert rows in db 
 
Start round 
 - shuffle(), deal()
 - prompt user_one to draw and discard

During round
 - users prompted to draw/discard in order
 - update db at end of each user's turn - or save & cache 'til end of round?
   - including round.deck, game_user.user_hand, and round.user_order_next

End of round
 - if(turn), user can go_out() (includes discard action)
   -- validate user's hand - if invalid, round continues
   -- if valid, update user's score & clear user's hand
   -- set end_of_round = true: all other users get only one more turn
      -- after each discard(), evaluate each of their hands and calculate score
 - after last user has discarded, start next round
